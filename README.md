# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
- This project aims to detect driver drowsiness in real-time using a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques. It utilizes a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model to monitor facial features such as eye closure and yawning. By analyzing these cues, the system can predict when a driver is becoming drowsy. Once drowsiness is detected, the system triggers an alert to warn the driver, helping to prevent potential accidents and improve road safety.
